## Project Overview
Our project aims to transform football scouting by integrating data science and sports analytics. We use the comprehensive Football Manager 2023 dataset to analyze player performances across multiple metrics. The system evaluates players based on factors like skill level, growth potential, and positional suitability, allowing scouts and teams to make more informed decisions.

### Key Features
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Harnessing rich datasets to provide detailed player analysis.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Using machine learning algorithms to forecast player development and performance.
- **Customizable Scouting Criteria**: Allowing users to set specific scouting requirements based on team needs.
- **Interactive Interface**: User-friendly visualization of data and results in Jupyter Notebook.

### Technical Approach
- **Data Collection**: Gathering and preprocessing data from Football Manager 2023.
- **Feature Engineering**: Identifying key features that influence player performance.
- **Model Development**: Implementing and training machine learning models to predict player outcomes.
- **Validation and Testing**: Evaluating the model's performance and fine-tuning parameters.
